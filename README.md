# This is a simple blockchain example implemented in Java.

# The code constructs a very simplified model of a cryptocurrency. There is no consensus mechanism (like proof of work), no cryptographic signatures to ensure the origin of transactions, no peer-to-peer network to distribute the blockchain, no mechanism to reward miners and no real security measures. The code is meant to be educational and not to be used in production.
