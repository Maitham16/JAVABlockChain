 Consensus Mechanisms:

One of the main aspects that make a blockchain possible is its consensus mechanisms. 
These algorithms are what allow nodes in a blockchain network to agree on the state 
of the shared ledger.

Two popular consensus mechanisms are:

    Proof of Work (PoW): This is the protocol that Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use. 
    It requires nodes to perform a certain amount of computational work to solve complex puzzles, 
    which makes spamming and manipulating the blockchain very costly.

    Proof of Stake (PoS): This is a newer consensus mechanism that several cryptocurrencies are 
    planning to transition to. Rather than requiring computational work, it requires nodes to 
    prove ownership of a certain number of tokens.
