 Smart Contracts:

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement being written 
into code. They are a key feature of many modern blockchain platforms. They can automate a 
variety of tasks, such as releasing funds when conditions are met, and can even be combined 
to create 'decentralized applications' (DApps).

Privacy and Security:

Blockchain technologies offer novel solutions to digital trust and privacy issues. However, 
they also have unique security considerations. For example, if an attacker manages to control 
more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate, they can reverse transactions and 
double-spend coinsâ€”a so-called 51% attack.
