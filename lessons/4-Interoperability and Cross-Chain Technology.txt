Interoperability and Cross-Chain Technology
Interoperability is a term used to describe the ability for different blockchain protocols to 
interact and communicate with each other. There are several projects currently working on 
cross-chain technology, which would allow for a seamless experience between all blockchain 
networks.

As for how to apply this in Java, there are several libraries that can be used to interact 
with blockchain networks, such as web3j for Ethereum, bitcoinj for Bitcoin and more. These 
libraries allow for the creation and management of wallets, crafting transactions, smart 
contract interaction and more.

For instance, using web3j to connect to an Ethereum network could look something like:

Web3j web3 = Web3j.build(new HttpService());  // defaults to http://localhost:8545/
Web3ClientVersion web3ClientVersion = web3.web3ClientVersion().sendAsync().get();
String clientVersion = web3ClientVersion.getWeb3ClientVersion();
